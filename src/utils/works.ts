      "Whether it's a romantic evening or a casual meetup, keep track of your experiences and make every date count! Elysian is a comprehensive web application designed for users to record their romantic and non-romantic dates, schedule future meetups, and plan dates effortlessly. Featuring interactive visual charts to showcase dating activity, Elysians helps users track their social life and stay organized. Additionally, users can share date ideas and post their success or horror dating stories, fostering a community of shared experiences and creativity.",
      "I spearheaded the design, frontend, and backend development of Elysian, tackling each problem systematically and breaking tasks into manageable pieces. This methodical approach ensured that each feature was developed efficiently and effectively, from creating a seamless user interface with engaging design elements to implementing backend functionalities for data management. Throughout the project, I relished the challenges and enjoyed the creative process, ultimately delivering a dynamic and user-friendly web application.",

      "A few problems that I faced while working on this project stemmed from utilizing Supabase, a backend-as-a-service, for the first time. I had some run-ins with the CRUD rules, and it took some time for me to figure out why data wasn't coming through from the backend, sometimes even after I had outlined the rules correctly. It also took some trial-and-error to master Supabase storage and how to appropriately categorize the images by user. The project was challenging (and fun) to code, but I also didn't hesitate to be free and creative with it. I approached the creation of the site with an anthropologist mindset, seeking to encourage the user to think about their dating habits and possibly why they date the way they do.",

Our curated collections are meticulously designed to transform living spaces into havens of sophistication. At Sylvan, we hold a steadfast commitment to customer satisfaction, understanding that every home is unique.",
      "I took on the challenge of designing and developing Sylvan Home Furniture, a full-stack ecommerce site for luxury furniture. I used various coding languages and subtle 2D animations to enhance the user experience without overcomplicating it. I used Figma to guide the design layout and typography and ensure that aesthetics and functionality worked together seamlessly. As I continued to work on it, Sylvan became a passion project, so I invested many, many hours in its development for days at a time, leading me to complete it in just 2.5 weeks, for both the design and development. Using Tailwind CSS deeply quickened the process, which made the responsiveness aspect of the project a lot less headache than if I were to use vanilla CSS or SCSS. Working with Firebase, I ensured smooth data handling and user authentication, keeping everything running effortlessly in the backend.",

      "I have used Redux for an open-source project before this project, but in this case, I was working alone with Redux, so I wanted to ensure that I truly understood and grasped how to use it effectively through watching Youtube videos and researching solutions on StackOverflow. It was the same with Stripe as well, which took some getting used to, and I ran into a lot of bugs when connecting the payment portal to my website, but after taking a step back, I was able to work through the problems with much satisfaction. I made sure to break my tasks down into checkboxes, taking every task one step at a time rather than focusing on multiple things at once. It made me stress a lot less and pay attention to the necessary details. Overall, I believe that this project conveys my design sense the best and highlights my skills as a UI designer and developer very well.",

Focusing on the frontend, mainly on the design aspect of the project, allowed me to work diligently and get used to the workflow of Next.js and TypeScript without focusing too hard on the more complex aspects of the framework, and eventually, I'd grown very comfortable using Next.js and much prefer it to vanilla React because of its flexibility and overall usability.",

Looking back, there's definitely some things that I would change and even things that might need tweaking, but overall, I had a lot of fun coding this passion project. My main goal for this project was to master the Javascript audio library since I really wanted to create a project that had a music player for some reason. At the time that I worked on this project, I was pretty good with React, but I still felt that I needed some more practice. With what I know now, I would most likely use a backend to allow users to add their own media so that they can truly personalize their page even more. But even so, I love the site for what it is. Even now when I land on the page, I feel a sense of comfort and coziness, which is the feeling that I want to invoke from the user.",
