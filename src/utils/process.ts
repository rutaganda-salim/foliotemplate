After submission, we set aside a meeting to discuss the client’s needs and schedule, ensuring that we both have all the necessary information we need before commencing the next step.",

      "Taking all the information that I’ve gathered from the debriefing, in this stage, I research and gather information involving the market and the brand’s competitors. I search for web design trends to keep the client’s site modern and inviting and organize a mood board to highlight my vision for the brand. I use my intuition to select the appropriate color scheme as well as the design layout and typography that truly reflects the brand’s goals and mission.",

    description:
      "After research, I start putting my ideas down on digital paper. Using Figma as my go-to design software, I wireframe and play around with design ideas until I’ve come up with a substantial amount of mockups to showcase. I typically start with designing the homepage first, and once I update the client via video call and we both reach a conclusion of the direction to go, then I start designing the other pages (if requested), using the homepage as a guide.",

    title: "Development",
    description:
      "Once the client is satisfied with the finalized design and presentation via Behance or Figma, this is when I commence the development phase of the project. I update the client on progress regularly and test the site for responsiveness, functionality, and performance across all devices before deployment. I also give the client a detailed run-down on certain features if there are more complicated elements that need further explanation.",
